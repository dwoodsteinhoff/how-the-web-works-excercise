    <h1>How the Web Works</h1>
    <h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
        <p>HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</p>
        <p>It is how to communicate between servers and browsers. How they get and send data to a server.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is a URL?</h2>
        <p> URL = Uniform Resource Locator</p>
        <p>It is the way to access an internet resource. It has a protocol, hostname, port (unviewable in the URL), a resource, and then a query.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is DNS</h2>
        <p>DNS = Domain Name System</p>
        <p>they take hostname(s) or URLs and translate it/them into a corresponding ip address</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is a query string?</h2>
        <p> It is extra information and is typically used in search bars to indicate the extra information. It is typically done like ?x=1&x=2 which are key-value pairs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>list two HTTP Verbs and their use cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>GET - Get data from a server</li>
            <li>POST - Send data to a server (often times they change the data on the server.)</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>what is an HTTP request?</h2>
        <p>
            A request from a browser to a server, using the HTTP protocol.
        </p>
    <br>
    <h2>what is an HTTP response?</h2>
        <p>
            A response from a server to the browser, using the HTTP protocol.
        </p>
    <br>
    <h2>what is an HTTP header? give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen</h2>
        <p>
            Additional informain about the requests and responses between the browser and server.
        </p>
        <h4>Request headers</h4>
            <li>Accept</li>
            <li>accept-language</li>
            <li>cookie</li>
            <li>Host</li>
            <li>Status Code</li>
        <h4> Response headers</h4>
            <li>Date</li>
            <li>Last-modified</li>
            <li>Server</li>
            <li>Content type</li>
    <br>
    <h2>What happens when you type a URL in a browser?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>The Browser turns the url or hostname into an IP address through the DNS</li>
        <li>The Browser then makes a request to that IP address</li>
        <li>The server responds to the request hopefully with a status code of 200 and not a 404(error:not found code)</li>
        <li>The browser makes the web page using the HTML and other resources located in the response</li>
        <li>If there are other resources, then the browser sends requests for those resources awaiting a response from the server</li>
    </ol>
